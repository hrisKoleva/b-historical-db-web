Azure website for Web UI with AI-assistant to browse and quickly find the exact infromation from our Historical Database. We have 1 hour to make an MVP with the tables and the stories from 02_prompts/01_use_case.md and 02_user_stories.md 

Use the index.html as a prototype ONLY but build a fully functional azurewebsite with acess to the Historical DB
Use the customer KLINGERWestad logo on the top of the page and Upkip in the site icon and menu, use the main.css for the main styles.

Ask me questions to verify every decision and commit to git when I accept the changes

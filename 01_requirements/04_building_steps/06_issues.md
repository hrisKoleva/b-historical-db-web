That Rollup failure comes from npm’s optional-dependency bug: the package-lock.json you generated on Windows only includes the Win32 @rollup/… binaries, so when the Linux GitHub runner tried to build it couldn’t find @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu. Instead of blowing away the lock, I tweaked the workflow so CI installs using npm install --prefix web (which is allowed to fetch the OS-specific optional packages) rather than npm ci. After the install, the pipeline still runs lint/test/build and deploys web/dist to the App Service. I also removed the temporary serve dependency and regenerated web/package-lock.json so the repo stays clean.
Push these changes (or rerun the updated “Frontend Pipeline”) and the build should pull the correct Rollup binary on Linux. If you see new diff in the workflow YAML or lockfile, that’s expected—go ahead and commit them.
